Beware! Most of their noodle dishes have fish sauce, chicken stock or the like. The server seemed annoyed that I even asked, and also said it wouldn't be possible to have a veggie protein in a salad. Their seitan was one note: salty. Better to try seasons 52 next door, which at least has some flavorful vegetarian options.", "aspects": "", "query": "", "relevant_reviews": ["", "", "", "", ""]}
