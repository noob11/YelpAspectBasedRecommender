{"review_id": "UJICiPFR0ncNEtD9_FoHEg", "text": "This place is not good for vegetarians and don't really seem to want to work with you to make anything a healthy vegetarian option that's also tasty.  Beware! Most of their noodle dishes have fish sauce, chicken stock or the like. The server seemed annoyed that I even asked, and also said it wouldn't be possible to have a veggie protein in a salad. Their seitan was one note: salty. Better to try seasons 52 next door, which at least has some flavorful vegetarian options.", "aspects": "vegetarian options, flavorful", "query": "vegetarian options", "relevant_reviews": ["Q386oqIwQsK2eGDToQf0kA", "4nZ19qPvw18o5eqnTPqY8A", "e5iY7IXXcDcKGcsquToVyg", "yA-t-s-p8-yqniRX_Gidxg", "ebxUuQal_DYHvmyq7MSpww"]}

I didn't come here for the food but rather the bourbon list as I was told it was amazing....the bourbon list was if fact amazing....problem was they actually didnt carry any of the bourbon on the list....after being told up front ALL of the pappy van Winkle was out of stock, they list like 6 of them on their menu, I was shot down on my next 5 attempts to order a bourbon....all put of stock.

The food was OK, our server was reasonably pleasant, but the night manager Matt Timms, when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill, was so off the charts rude- my friends and I will never come back!  Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.

I'm sad to say I was disappointed. \n\nThe food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order \"enough\" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch. \n\nIf you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere.
