The food was OK, our server was reasonably pleasant, but the night manager Matt Timms, when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill, was so off the charts rude- my friends and I will never come back!  Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.

I'm sad to say I was disappointed. \n\nThe food was amazing, but the atomosphere and service were way below the the prices they charge. It felt like a cheap club with fantastic food. Very disconnected. Our server was condecending. She seemed annoyed we didn't order \"enough\" (she'd recommended 2-3 cold dishes, 2-3 hot dishes, and 2 sushi rolls) but that was our choice. We'd had a late lunch. \n\nIf you just want good food, I'd recommend saving your money and going elsewhere.
